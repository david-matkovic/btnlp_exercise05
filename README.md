# btnlp_exercise005

In this exercise we used a preprocessed twitter dataset from Assignments 3 and 4 and used sentiment analysis tools like VADER, NLTK, spaCy, and TextBlob. We learned about how the different libraries work, the pros and cons of having a neutral polarity option (as opposed to a binary positive/negative scale), and analyzed how well NLTK/VADER and spaCy/TextBlob did in terms of predicting the sentiment polarities of tweets. 

Our more detailed reflections are in the LaTeX file. We talk briefly about how the sentiment analysis tools work and our results from using the Twitter dataset. Some further veins of investigation include doing this exercise again but with a custom stopword list; keeping emojis/emoticons in the tweets and refining the pre-processing stage, to hopefully get a more accurate depiction of the true sentiment of the tweets.

We applied basic knowledge to compiling a LaTeX file, including using bibreferences and accounting for formatting issues.
